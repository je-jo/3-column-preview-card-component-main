## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The aim was to stop relying on flexbox so much and use grid instead.

### Continued development

Try not to worry about exact pixels, as working from .jpg is just a pain. Instead, try to learn something new from each challenge.
